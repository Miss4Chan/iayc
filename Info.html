                <h3> The fusion engine</h3>
                <p>
                    The Fusion Driven Rocket (FDR) is a much more efficient propulsion system for in-space transportation than the current space shuttle
                    engines that are propelled through chemical combustion. Although this engine is the slowest in the game, it has not yet been successfully built.
                    However, as John Slough claims, this propulsion system is easily extrapolated from contemporary technology. Additionally, Slough explains
                    “It employs a solid lithium propellant that requires no significant tankage mass. The propellant is rapidly heated and accelerated to high exhaust velocity
                    (> 30 km/s), while having no significant physical interaction with the spacecraft thereby avoiding damage to the rocket and limiting
                    both the thermal heat load and radiator mass.”
                    Now, let's quantify the properties of the Fusion Engine. With the help of Matt O’Dowd’s calculations, we established that a
                    real-life journey to Alpha Centauri, a star system about 4.73 light years away, will require the energy of 300 000 one-megaton
                    Hydrogen bombs that will be blasted behind the spacecraft, accelerating it up to 10% the speed of light. This journey would take 90 years!
                    Luckily for you, thanks to the power of simulation, you can virtually travel to this destination in about thirty minutes due to the mechanics
                    of our game. You will enjoy a first-class ticket to view the ethereal beauty of our neighbouring solar system.

                <h3> The antimatter drive</h3>
                <p>
                    Within the chambers of the Antimatter Drive, particles of matter and antimatter collide in an epic
                    “explosion”. This controlled annihilation, as  Keane and Zhang outline in their paper “Beamed Core Antimatter
                    Propulsion: Engine Design and Optimization”,  releases an incredible amount of energy that can be utilized to provide
                    thrust to a spacecraft. In reality, although our technology can produce antimatter, the amount necessary to run the Antimatter
                    Drive is economically unfavorable due to the energy requirement.
                    However, through our game you can escape reality and venture into a journey through the stellar expanse on-board
                    a star vessel that is propelled by an Antimatter Drive - an engine fifty times more powerful than the Fusion Drive!
                    Your trip to Mars requires 10 grams of Antimatter and you will be able to achieve speeds from 50% up to 80% of the speed of light.

                <h3> The Black Hole Drive; “Schwarzschild Kugelblitz Starship”</h3>
                <p>
                    The Schwarzschild Kugelblitz: evidence of theoretical brilliance!
                    Although unachievable by modern or near-future technology, this engine is powered by an artificial black hole.
                    Its name, the “Kugelblitz” is German for “ball of lightning”. Accordingly, the artificial black hole is made from highly
                    focused laser light. As explained in Jeffrey S. Lee’s paper, sufficient energy densities can bend the fabric of space-time
                    and create a singularity. This Black Hole will radiate Hawking Radiation that can be efficiently used as a propellant.
                    Our game makes these theoretical ideas a product of a simulated reality! The black hole that our Schwarzschild Kugelblitz
                    Starship has is about 600 billion kilograms, roughly the size of a single proton. This theoretical sweet-spot gives a black
                    hole that radiates around 160 petawatts of energy; roughly equal to 10,000 times the world’s current power consumption.
                    Its estimated “life time” prior to evaporation due to Hawking Radiation, as calculated by Jeffrey S. Lee is 3.5 years.
                    How fast can this scientific “monstrosity” go? You will be able to experience this for yourself! (A little hint:
                    it can reach 10% the speed of light in just 20 days!)
